### I'm Raghavendra Dheeraj Peddinti. There's more to me than that long name.

I was a kid but now I am an engineer-turned-scientist, researching the topics of computational sciences.[^1]

- I’m currently occupied thinking, over-thinking and thinking over and over. In the free time, I develop quantum-inspired algorithms.[^2]
- Would love to learn the blurry boundaries of science and philosophy, but who knows if learning is a real phenomena.

- Fun fact: the word logic comes from the ancient Greek λόγος (lógos, “speech, reason”)[^3].
