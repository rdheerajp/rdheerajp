### I'm Raghavendra Dheeraj Peddinti. There's more to me than that long name.

I was a kid, but now I am an engineer-turned-scientist who is researching the topics of computational sciences.[^1]

- I'm currently occupied thinking, over-thinking, and thinking over and over. Otherwise, I develop quantum-inspired algorithms.[^2]
- I would love to learn the blurry boundaries of science and philosophy, but who knows if learning is a real phenomenon?

- Fun fact: the word logic comes from the ancient Greek λόγος (lógos, "speech, reason")[^3].


[^1]: My master's program is called [Compuational Science](https://rw.ethz.ch/ "MSc Comp. Sci."), which is at the intersection of math, physics, and computer science.
